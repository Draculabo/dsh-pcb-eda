/**
 * Workspace package discovery for the Huaqiu DSH repo.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "which packages exist here" — every script in
 * `scripts/` should derive its package set from this module instead of keeping
 * its own hardcoded list. A new package dropped into `packages/` is picked up
 * automatically by bump / publish / checks / launch.
 *
 * Discovery is driven by the actual filesystem — each subdirectory of
 * `packages/` that carries a package.json — not by the root manifest or any
 * in-repo enumeration. Subsets are derived from each package's own manifest:
 *
 *   - `publishablePackages()` — everything under `packages/` that is meant for
 *     npm (has a name/version and is not marked `private: true`). The whole
 *     repo is released as one unit, so this is the release set.
 *   - `dshPlugins()` — packages that declare a `dsh` config (i.e. they are
 *     real DSH plugins and can be registered with `dsh plugin add`). The
 *     app/server/utility packages (`component-gen-*`, `dsh-tool-uncollapse`)
 *     ship to npm but are not plugins, so they are excluded here.
